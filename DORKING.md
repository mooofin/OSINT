intro
Google Dorking, also known as Google hacking, is a technique used to find specific information and vulnerabilities on the internet by utilizing advanced search operators in Google. By crafting precise search queries, users can uncover sensitive data, such as exposed files, passwords, and confidential information, which are inadvertently made publicly accessible. This method leverages Googleâ€™s indexing capabilities to sift through vast amounts of web content, making it a powerful tool for both cybersecurity professionals and malicious actors
